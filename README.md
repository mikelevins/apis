A worker bee for application hives

Apis is a Common Lisp library that supports shared-nothing concurrency and
distributed processing.

Its current version supports local message passing. Past versions, which are still accessible in the git history, supported distributed processing with message delivery to remote processes and hosts. Apis is in active development and I expect to restore those features in due course.
