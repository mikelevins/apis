Apis: a worker bee for building application hives

Apis is a set of libraries that support building applications using
multiple processes, shared-nothing concurrency, and, optionally,
distributed processing.

A "cocoa" subsystem is not in place that supports building a skeleton
Cocoa application on OSX. A savvy user could probably extend it into a
fully-function OSX GUI application.

I plan to add support for similar skeleton apps on Windows and Linux
sooon.
