# Stage

Stage is intended to be a platform-neutral presentation server for
Apis applications.

The presentation server currently under development is built using the
Lispworks CAPI. The Stage sources are distributed with Apis under the
same license, namely the Apache License, Version 2.0. You're free to
build or modify Stage, but you'll need a licensed copy of Lispworks to
do so. Lispworks is available from:

  http://www.lispworks.com/

If you just want to use Stage as a presentation server for Apis
programs, you'll be able to download free binaries when Stage is
ready, built from the sources in this project.

If you prefer to use an entirely free platform to work with Apis, or
if you want to port Stage to platforms not supported by Lispworks, I
encourage you to write your own implementation of Stage. I'll be happy
to help as much as I can.
